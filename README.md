Bootcamp Leaflet-Challenge - Module 15
This project was created as a homework assignment to visualize USGS earthqake data. 

The html file is contained in the StarterCode folder and the main JavaScript file is located in the static>js folder labeled logic.js.

References: The data includes all earthquakes from the last 7 days and was read in from the USGS website: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

The index.html and style.css files were provided to me as a starting point.
